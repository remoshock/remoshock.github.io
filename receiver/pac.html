<p> PAC have large contacts, therefore reducing the risk of skin damage. At low
power levels they are rather harmless, but they are unbearable on higher levels.
The minimum pulse duration is 250ms (it is 500ms for most other receivers).

<p> The ACX and BCX collars as well as the ATX and DTX transmitters are compatible
to each other. No tests have been made with the NDTX and ETX transmitters and the ECX
receiver, yet. But it is likely that they use a different protocol.
