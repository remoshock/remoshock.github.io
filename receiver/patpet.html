Frequency: 915 MHz</div>

<p> This nameless collar operates on 915 MHz. The remote offers the power levels 0 to 5
for both vibration and shocks. The transmission protocol, however, uses values between
0 and 100. So a level 5 shock as shown on the display of the remote control
translates to a power level of 100 in the transmission message.

<p> The collar has a button to turn the collar on, but it cannot be switched off again.
Although it goes into sleep mode after one minute, the battery is drained within days.
