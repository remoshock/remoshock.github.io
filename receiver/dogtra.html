<p> There are several diffent models of Dogtra receivers. Unfortunately they use incompatible protocols. 

<p> At this time only the 200NCP and 600NCP models are supported. Both of these models
have a hard code transmitter code which cannot be changed. There is no pairing protocol.
In most cases the transmitter code is printed on a tiny white sticker. The following pictures show the transmitter code 294.
