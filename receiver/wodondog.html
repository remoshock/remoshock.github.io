<p> There are several versions of Wodondog style collars. Although they look very
similar from the outside, they are very different on the inside:

<p> The version on the left has a bright white flashlight on the receiver
that can be activated by holding down the light button on the transmitter
for several seconds. The version on the right is missing this light.

<p> Both versions use different transmission protocols on 433 MHz. They are incompatible.

<p> Further more, there are reports on the Internet that there is a version
of this collar that operates on 915 MHz instead. There are also images that
show the Wodondog brand name printed on the transmitter.
