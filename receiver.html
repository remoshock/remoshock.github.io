<p> Note: There are at least two versions of this collar that look almost identical:

<p> One version has "PATENT NO. 200930186633.4" written onto it. This device creates a
very stingy pain even at level 1. I am worried that it uses a relative high current
and is likely to curse skin burn.

<p> There is no writing on the other version. But it has a green power LED on the
opposite side of the blinking red LED. The impulse feels very different from the
other version.

<p> Both versions use the exact same transmission protocol and the transmitters
are compatible. Further more, this collar is sold using different brand names,
but it is unclear which brand name uses which version.

<h2>Wodongdog</h2>

<p> There are several versions of Wodondog style collars. Although they look very
similar from the outside, they are very different on the inside:

<p> One version has a white light on the receiver that can be activated by
holding down the light button on the transmitter for several seconds.
The other versions is missing this light.

<p> Both versions use different transmission protocols on 433 MHz. They are incompatible.

<p> Further more, there are reports on the Internet that there is a version
of this collar that operates on 915 MHz instead. There are also images that
show the Wodondog brand name printed on the transmitter.
