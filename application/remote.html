<p> Interactive Remote Control allows to trigger from a web browser,
e. g. from a mobile phone.

<p> The remote control offers one colored box for each configured receiver. The
title and color can be defined in .config/remoshock.ini.

<p> There are two input fields with an attached slider each. The first one configures
the power level for vibration and shock commands in percent. The second one defines the
duration.

<p> There is a button for a beep sound and a shock. There is an additional button,
which shows both icons. This button will trigger one beep sound, wait one second, and
then trigger a shock. The shock will obey power level and duration as set above.

<p> You will need to start <a href="remoshockserver.html"><tt>remoteshockserver</tt></a>
in a terminal window on the computer connected to the SDR. It will start a web
server and print the url.
