<p> remoshockserver will start a web server, that will provide a user interface
as shown on the screenshot.

<p> The webpage will work on mobile devices, provided that the mobile device
can reach the IP address of the computer. For example because both devices
are in the same Wifi network.

<p> You may make the server available on the Internet, if your computer has a public
IP-address, either directly or via a VPN/tunnel. Furthermore SSH reverse port
forwarding does work. This documentation, however, will not go into detail
on how to make a server available to the Internet because of the security
implications.

<p> <code>remoshockserver</code> will start the server and print the URL. The port and
authentication token may be configured in remoshock.ini.
