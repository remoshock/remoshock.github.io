<p> The Randomizer sends randomized commands at random times. For example it may
send a beep followed a shock every 5 to 15 minutes. For a completely deterministic
experience, you can set min and max to the same value.

<p> This sample configuration will ensure that there is always (100% probability)
a beep followed by a shock. The shock duration will vary between 1000ms and
1000ms, thus not vary at all. The power of the shocks will 30%. And finally the
timer will be set to a random value between 5 minutes (300s) and 15 minutes (900s).

<p> After the event the timer will be set to a new random value in this range and
everything will start anew. In this example the randomizer will end after one hour
or when Ctrl+c is pressed. The runtime starts counting after
the optional initial start_delay has expired.

<p> Some settings can be fine tuned on a per receiver basis.

<p> You can close the web page after the randomizer was started. Furtheremore, you can
use other web applications such as the remote control while the randomizer is active.

<p> The default values will be read from the <a href="remoshockrnd.html">randomizer section
of remoshock.ini</a>.

<p> You will need to start <a href="remoshockserver.html"><tt>remoteshockserver</tt></a>
in a terminal window on the computer connected to the SDR. It will start a web
server and print the url. 

<p> There is a command line alternative available: <a href="remoshockrnd.html"><tt>remoshockrnd</tt></a>.
