<p> The gamepad game will highlight buttons on screen that a player has to press on a
gamepad. In the screenshot the buttons LT, RT and X have to be pressed. The green border
around LT and RT indicate that these buttons are actually pressed.

<p> Both normal gamepads and dance mats are supported. For gamepads it is recommanded to
require that LT and RT are held down at all times. This prevents the player from taking
either hand away from the gamepad.

<p> In the settings dialog various parameters can be configured. The game runs for the
number of minutes specified as "Runtime". "Pich interval" indicates the number of seconds
before a new button is selected. Please note that higher timing might seem easier but
might actually be harder on a mental level. The player must press the button within
the specified "Reaction time" in order to avoid punishment. The punishment is repeated
after the "Immune time" expired, unless the player is complying.

<p> The setting "Play buttons" indicates which buttons are in player. This might be important
if your controller is missing buttons or if you are using a dance pad with different buttons.
"Hold buttons" is similar to "Play buttons" but these buttons have to be pressed the whole time.
This can be used to prevent the player from removing either hand from the gamepad.

<p> You will need to start <a href="remoshockserver.html"><tt>remoteshockserver</tt></a>
in a terminal window on the computer connected to the SDR. It will start a web
server and print the url.
