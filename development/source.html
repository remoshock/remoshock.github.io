<h1>Source Code</h1>

<p> Before you start working on the source code, please refer to the <a href="/setup.html">Setup Guide</a>.

<h2 id="github"><a href="#github"><svg class="svg-icon"><use xlink:href="{{ '/assets/minima-social-icons.svg#github' | relative_url }}"></use></svg> Get the source code</a></h2>

<p> <i>remoshock</i> is open source. You can find the source code at <a href="https://github.com/remoshock/remoshock">https://github.com/remoshock/remoshock</a>

<p> To checkout the project and run the cli tool:

<pre>
git clone git@github.com:remoshock/remoshock
cd remoshock/src/
./remoshockcli 
</pre>

<h3 id="command"><a href="#command">Commands and Actions</a></h3>

<a href="command.svg"><img src="command.svg"></a>

<p> A command consists of the number of the targeted receiver, the action to perform (e. g. VIBRATE), 
the power level in percent and the duration in milliseconds. The main actions are BEEP, VIBRATE and SHOCK.

<p> For condition training, there is a special action called BEEPSHOCK. It will play a beep sound, wait one
second and follow up with a shock of the specified power level and duration.

<p> Some receiver types will shut down after a period of inactivity with neither movement nor commands. The action
KEEPAWAKE will be sent to those receivers periodically. The KEEPAWAKE commands are only sent, if they are
required by the configured receiver type. Furthermore, they are only sent, if remoshockserver or remoshockrnd
are running. If you are using remoshockcli, you will have to deal with sleep mode yourself.


<h3 id="programstructure"><a href="#programstructure">Program Structure</a></h3>

<a href="programstructure.svg"><img src="programstructure.svg"></a>

<p> The central class is Remoshock. It receives commands from the classes on the left hand side.
Based on the configuration file $HOME/.config/remoshock.ini. It sets up a list of receivers, to which
it forwards commands.

<p> There is one class for each receiver type, which will generate the appropriate message
based on the command details. In those classes the device specific logic is implemented. So if you
plan to add support for an additional receiver, here is the place to look for examples. There is a 
document with information on how to <a href="analyze.html">analyze</a> a remote protocol.

<p> Receiver classes use an implementation of the SdrSender class to actually transmit the message.
At this time, there are two implementation: One uses the command line tool provided by Universal Radio Hacker.
The other one calls directly into the URH program code in order to prevent a 1 second delay.

<p> One day, there should be a SdrSender implementation which uses the small hackrf_tramsfer cli instead of URH.
Further more, it is possible to write an implementation for a cheap 433MHz transmitter boards instead
of a software defined radio. But this will only work with receivers operating on 433MHz using OOK.
