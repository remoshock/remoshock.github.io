<h1>üîç Analyze Transmission Protocols</h1>

One day, this will be a nice guide. For now, it is just a collections of notes


<ul>
<li> In Universal Radio Hacker (urh), record the signal. It is most likely on one of the following frequncies: 27M, 915M, 433M.
Do not forget the "M".

<li> After recoding the signal, delete all the empty spaces (as they use up a lot of RAM and harddisk space) and save

<li> In view "spectrogram" apply a bandwidth filter around the yellow line.

<li> Select ASK (for on-off-keying) or FSK (when the signal jumps between two frequencies)

<li> correct noise value which tends to see everything as noise

<li> View Demodulated and pull the green-red-devider to the correct position: Careful do not confuse a message and the pause between two messages as 1 and 0, but make sure to use the correct zoom level.

<li> ....
</ul>


Please have a look at the <a href="source.html#programstructure">program structure</a> to find the source code of implementation for known receivers.
