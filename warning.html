<h1>Warning</h1>

<h2 id="electricity"><a href="#electricity">Electricity</a></h2>

<p> Please be very careful when playing with electricity because electricity
may cause serious medical issues. This includes both an impact on the
nervous system as well as damage to the skin.

<h3>Nerves</h3>

<p> Please read this article: <a href="https://www.domme-chronicles.com/2021/02/shock-collars-in-bdsm-play-are-they-safe">Shock collars around the neck are not safe</a>.

<h3>Skin</h3>

<h3>Why did you publish this software anyway?</h3>

<p> This is a good question. I hesitated for several months whether I should
actually release it. 

<p> It started as a lockdown project in order to have something to do and
learn Arduino. After I got familiar with hardware-near programming,
I bought a pair of cheap shock collars which operate on 433 MHz.
This worked well from the software point of view.

<p> But I am quite unhappy about those receivers. They have a very sharp pain
even on level 1. Unlike the PAC collars which are pretty harmless on low
levels but escalate to unbearable. I am concerned that the cheap devices
might have a significantly higher risk regarding skin damage.

<p> Unfortunately, it is this kind of collar, for which there is plenty of 
code available on the Internet.

<p> All in all: Do not play with electricity! But if you do, please be careful
and use high-quality products.
